Attempt to predict stock prices using ML.
It uses PyTorch as the framework and W&B with nice candle plots to visualize it's predictions. 

## Current status

A trained model can predict the stock price pretty well using the follow hyper parameters:
- TIME: `30`
- LAYERS: `2`

## Roadmap

- Multi dim predictions => close, open, low and high
- Improve loss function
