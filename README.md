Attempt to predict stock prices using ML.
It uses PyTorch as the framework and W&B with nice candle plots to visualize it's predictions. 

## Current status

It predicts the stock price for the next day, but not good enough.

## Roadmap

- Improve dataset + use of data
- Improve Conv layers and LSTM
- Decrease size of vanilla nearons (optimize)
- Improve loss function
